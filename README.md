# Karate VR for Meta Quest 3
Our project aims to revolutionize karate training through a virtual reality (VR) platform. The game allows users to practice kumite defensive techniques and blocks with real-time feedbacks of their movements. 

This system exploits Meta Quest 3 built-in cameras to map the user's hands and recongize gestures.
